Video colorization is a classical problem in digital image processing, aimed at transforming grayscale video sequences into color frames. Traditional techniques include manual tinting, example-based color transfer, and more recently, deep-learning-based reconstruction. The goal of this work is to provide an accessible, deterministic MATLAB implementation that avoids neural models while still achieving visually appealing results.
